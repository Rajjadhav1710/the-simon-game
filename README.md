The simon game is memory game which test your memory power. this game is created using simple frontend technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery and browser's audio api. i created this game while learning about jQuery. exciting part is the game is in marvel theme for MCU fans like me. every time user taps on one of four tiles it will create sound of one of the marvel character. so increase the volume of your device and enjoy the game.
